        <p class="mission">
          We are a team of three passionate Computer Science students—Abby, Grace,
          and Kaya. Our mission is to make learning programming concepts exciting,
          fun, and accessible through interactive and engaging games.

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
          Using powerful tools like GameMaker and Unity, we design and develop games that teach programming concepts in a fun and interactive way. 
          Our goal is to make programming accessible for everyone, no matter their age or experience level.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          We believe learning should be fun! That’s why we’re using games to teach fundamental programming concepts, problem-solving, and logical thinking.
          We hope to inspire the next generation of coders to fall in love with technology, just like we did.
